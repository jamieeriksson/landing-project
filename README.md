## Summary

This project aimed to convert a landing page into a non-static project through the use of Javascript. Functionality was added to auto-populate a navigation bar based on the number of sections in the html file, create active states and styling based on the section currently being viewed on the screen, and to hide the navigation bar when the user was not scrolling.

## Disclosures

The index.html and styles.css files were provided by Udacity.com. Some small changes were made unique to this version of the project, but the majority of the code in these files is from Udacity.
